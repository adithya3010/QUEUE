# Smart Queue 
( Live https://smart-queue-theta.vercel.app/ )

Smart Queue is a full-stack web application that digitizes and simplifies queue management for real-world use cases such as clinics, service centers, offices, and counters.

Users can take and track queue numbers through a clean frontend interface, while the backend manages queue state, validations, and real-time updates.

## 🚀 Features

- Digital queue ticket generation
- Real-time queue status tracking
- Backend-driven queue management
- Modular backend architecture
- Modern frontend built with Vite
- Designed for scalability and real-world usage

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 🔹 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- Git

---

### 🔧 Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
````

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and configure required environment variables.

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on the configured port (default: `http://localhost:5000`).
Change the Cors in server.js the origin to the url of frontend localhost
since it is connected to Deployed Website (Using Vercel)

---

### 🎨 Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend/vite-project
npm install
npm run dev
```
change the base url in services of app.js and socket.js
to the backend local route 

Open the URL shown in the terminal to access the frontend application.

---

## 🔁 How the System Works

1. Users access the frontend and request a queue ticket.
2. Requests are sent to the backend via REST APIs.
3. Backend manages queue state and validations.
4. Queue updates are reflected in real time using sockets.
5. Staff/admin actions advance or modify the queue.
